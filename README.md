This project follows the principles of database normalization from 1NF to 5NF to ensure data consistency, eliminate redundancy, and support efficient database design. In First Normal Form (1NF), all data is atomic with no repeating groups. Second Normal Form (2NF) removes partial dependencies in composite keys, while Third Normal Form (3NF) eliminates transitive dependencies. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) refines 3NF by ensuring that every determinant is a super key. Fourth Normal Form (4NF) addresses multi-valued dependencies by separating independent data sets, and Fifth Normal Form (5NF) resolves join dependencies to ensure lossless decomposition. Additionally, the project maintains transactional integrity using ACID properties—Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability—ensuring that all database operations are reliable, consistent, and recoverable even in case of failures.
